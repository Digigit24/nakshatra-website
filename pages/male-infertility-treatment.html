                  Are you and your partner struggling to conceive? You’re not alone—male infertility is more common than
                  most
                  people
                  realise, and the good news is that it’s treatable. <br>
                  At the Nakshatra IVF & Sexual Wellness Clinic in Pune, we specialise in helping men improve their
                  fertility
                  through personalised treatment, advanced technology, and compassionate care. <br>
                  Our approach is simple — we listen, we understand, and we treat the root cause, not just the symptoms.
                  Whether it’s
                  hormonal imbalance, poor sperm health, or lifestyle factors, our team is here to help you every step
                  of the way.

                      Male infertility refers to a man’s inability to contribute to conception due
                      to
                       low sperm count, poor sperm motility, abnormal sperm shape, or
                        hormonal imbalance .
                      It can be diagnosed through semen analysis and other fertility tests at
                       Nakshatra Clinic in Pune .

                    <p>
                      Yes, many male infertility conditions can be treated without surgery.
                       Hormonal therapies, medications, lifestyle modifications, and
                        antioxidant supplements 
                      often restore sperm function and improve conception chances naturally when

                    <p>
                      Absolutely.  IVF and ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) 
                      are advanced fertility
                      techniques that help overcome low sperm count, poor motility, or abnormal
                      morphology. Even with
                      very few healthy sperm, ICSI can give couples a  higher chance of
                        successful pregnancy .

                      Chronic stress can  lower testosterone levels, reduce sperm

                        and genetic testing . These tests help assess sperm quality,
                      detect blockages, and identify
                      hormonal or structural abnormalities that may be affecting male fertility.
