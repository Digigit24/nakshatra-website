									Ovum donation brings hope to women who face challenges conceiving with their own eggs. We understand the emotional journey of aspiring parents and offer advanced Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) to help them achieve their dream. In this process, a healthy donor’s unfertilized egg is carefully fertilized in our modern IVF laboratory, and the resulting embryo is transferred into the recipient’s uterus.

 This safe and effective treatment helps overcome issues such as poor egg quality or low ovarian reserve, giving women the chance to experience the joy of motherhood. Nakshatra Clinic is dedicated to providing compassionate and ethical ovum donation treatments in Pune.

							<h2 style="font-size: xx-large;">Ovum Donation Procedure at Nakshatra Clinic</h2>
							
							<h3 style="font-size: x-large;">1. Donor Selection and Medical Screening</h3>
							<p>
								The ovum donation process begins with selecting a healthy and suitable egg donor. At Nakshatra Clinic, we maintain a registry of pre-screened donors who meet strict medical, physical, and psychological criteria.
							</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Donors are aged between 21–35 years.</li>
                <li>They undergo a complete health check-up, genetic testing, and screening for infectious diseases such as HIV, Hepatitis B & C, and Syphilis.</li>
                <li>A psychological assessment ensures emotional readiness for the process.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Only donors who meet all ethical and medical guidelines are approved for egg donation.</p>
							
							<h3 style="font-size: x-large;">2. Ovarian Stimulation</h3>
							<p>
								Once selected, the donor undergoes controlled ovarian stimulation using hormonal injections. These medications help produce multiple mature eggs instead of the single egg normally released during a menstrual cycle.

Throughout this phase, our fertility specialists closely monitor the donor’s response with regular ultrasound scans and blood tests to ensure safety and effectiveness.
							</p>
							
							<h3 style="font-size: x-large;">3. Egg Retrieval (Ovum Pick-Up)</h3>
							<p>
								When the donor’s eggs are ready, the retrieval is performed through a minor procedure known as Transvaginal Ovarian Aspiration.
							</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The donor is given mild sedation or anaesthesia for comfort.</li>
                <li>Using an ultrasound-guided needle, the mature eggs are carefully collected from the ovaries.</li>
                <li>The entire procedure takes about 30 minutes and does not require a hospital stay.</li>
               
              </ul>
               <p>After retrieval, the donor is advised to rest for a day or two and may receive mild pain relief if needed.</p>
							
							<h3 style="font-size: x-large;">4. Fertilisation and Embryo Development</h3>
							<p>
								The retrieved eggs are immediately taken to our advanced IVF laboratory.
							</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The eggs are fertilised using either the partner’s sperm or donor sperm through the IVF or ICSI technique.</li>
                <li>The fertilised eggs develop into embryos over the next 3–5 days under expert embryologist supervision.</li>
                <li>Only the healthiest embryos are selected for transfer or freezing.</li>
              </ul>
							
							<h3 style="font-size: x-large;">5.Embryo Transfer to Recipient</h3>
							<p>
								The developed embryos are transferred into the recipient’s uterus using a painless and precise catheter technique.

This marks the beginning of the implantation phase, where the embryo attaches to the uterine lining to initiate pregnancy.

Any remaining embryos can be cryopreserved (frozen) for future use.
							</p>

							<h3 style="font-size: x-large;">6. Aftercare and Support</h3>
							<p>
								At Nakshatra Clinic, both the egg donor and recipient receive complete post-procedure care.
							</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Donors are monitored for any minor side effects such as bloating or discomfort.</li>
                <li>Recipients are guided with medications and lifestyle advice to support successful implantation.</li>
                <li>Our in-house fertility counsellors provide emotional and psychological support throughout the journey.</li>
              </ul>

                  <div class="accordion-answer">
                    <p> Ovum donation (also called egg donation) is when a healthy donor woman provides her unfertilised eggs which are then fertilised and the resulting embryo is transferred into the recipient’s uterus. At our clinic in Pune, the process includes donor screening, ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, fertilisation and embryo transfer. Contact us to schedule your consultation and learn how our ovum donation in Pune works.</p>

                  <div class="accordion-answer">
                    <p>  Egg donation IVF in Pune is an option for women with low ovarian reserve, poor egg quality, advanced age‐related fertility decline, genetic disorders, or repeated IVF failure using their own eggs. If you’ve been advised that your eggs may not be viable, ask us about our egg donation IVF programme.</p>

                  <div class="accordion-answer">
                    <p> Donor criteria typically include a young healthy woman (often 21-35 years), no communicable/inherited disorders, normal ovarian reserve, and a good general health profile. Our screening also includes blood tests, ultrasound, genetic screening and psychological assessment. Ask about our full “egg donor criteria” list during your visit. </p>

                  <button class="accordion-question" aria-expanded="false">Q4:What is the procedure for egg retrieval and embryo transfer at your Pune clinic?
</button>
                  <div class="accordion-answer">
                    <p>After stimulation with hormonal injections, the donor undergoes transvaginal ultrasound-guided egg retrieval (under sedation), usually within about 30 minutes. The eggs are fertilised (IVF/ICSI) and embryos cultured; then the best embryo is transferred into the recipient’s uterus. This is part of our egg donation IVF process in Pune.</p>

                  <button class="accordion-question" aria-expanded="false">Q5:What are the risks or side-effects associated with ovum donation?
?</button>
                  <div class="accordion-answer">
                    <p>Risks are low, but may include mild discomfort, cramping, minimal bleeding or risk of infection after egg retrieval. The stimulation could cause ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) in rare cases. We monitor donors closely and provide after-care. If you experience breathing difficulty, rapid weight gain, stomach pain or vomiting post-donation, seek prompt help.</p>
